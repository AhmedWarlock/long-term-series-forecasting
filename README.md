# Long-Term Series Forecasting (LTSF) on Weather Dataset

This repository contains the implementation of various models for **long-term time series forecasting (LTSF)** using the Weather dataset. The project is focused on evaluating the effectiveness of linear and transformer-based models for forecasting meteorological indicators over extended periods.

##  Weather Dataset

 Weather statistics recorded every 10 minutes for the entire year 2020.
- **Features**: 
    21 meteorological indicators,such as air temperature, wind speed, radiation, etc.
- **Splits**: 
    The dataset is split in a chronological order to maintain the time dependency of the series: **70% / 10% / 20%** (first 70% for training, next 10% for validation, and the final 20% for testing).

## Task

### Multivariate Forecasting
- **Objective**: Use multiple weather indicators (features) as input to predict future values of all features simultaneously.
